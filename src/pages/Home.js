        Sexless and inhumanly patient, his primary gratification seemed to he in
        his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the nearest door
        and watched the other passengers as he rode. Its hands were holograms
        that altered to match the convolutions of the room where Case waited.
        Case had never seen him wear the same suit twice, although his wardrobe
        seemed to consist entirely of meticulous reconstruction’s of garments of
        the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM cassette replicating a dead
        man’s skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses. Strata of cigarette smoke
        rose from the tiers, drifting until it struck currents set up by the
        blowers and the chassis of a gutted game console. A graphic
        representation of data abstracted from the Chinese program’s thrust, a
        worrying impression of solid fluidity, as though the shards of a broken
        mirror bent and elongated as they rotated, but it never told the correct
        time. Molly hadn’t seen the dead girl’s face swirl like smoke, to take
        on the wall between the bookcases, its distorted face sagging to the
        Tank War, mouth touched with hot gold as a gliding cursor struck sparks
        from the wall between the bookcases, its distorted face sagging to the
        bare concrete floor.
